To install Pillow run:    
  python -m install Pillow
  
  Then run the script given this will show a couple of things.  First it will ask you where your picture is "filePath = input("Please enter the full path to your image including the extension: ")
  
  Then we can run a couple of commands against the picture, change its size, rotate it 90 degrees, and then decrease the brightness of the photo
  
  Thanks for running my script
